  This library was written to facilate mock call verification on self made mock objects. It tries to provide its users with a lightweight, intuitive, clear-cut and transparent api.
  
  In the near future, an examples project will be linked where the api is illustrated and some mocking templates are provided.
  
  **This library is very much in-development at this moment and it is therefore not recommended to use it to test production code.**
